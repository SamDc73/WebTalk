+the app is able to prefrom some action like this "python main.py "Go to Google search for openaAI dev day and open the first video" --method xpath --show-visuals" but for something like this it fails "python main.py "Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo fill the form were my first name is Husam my ln is alshehadat and my email is sam@gmai.com" --method xpath --show-visuals" I think the problm have to do with it's ability to prefrom multiple action in the same page /url simultaneously .
