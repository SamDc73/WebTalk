#### the app is able to prefrom some action like this "python main.py "Go to Google search for openaAI dev day and open the first video" --method xpath --show-visuals" but for something like this it fails "python main.py "Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo fill the form were my first name is Husam my ln is alshehadat and my email is sam@gmai.com" --method xpath --show-visuals" I think the problm have to do with it's ability to prefrom multiple action in the same page /url simultaneously .

To address the issue of performing multiple actions on the same page/URL simultaneously, we need to enhance the `DecisionMaker` class to handle sequences of actions. This involves:

1. Modifying the `make_decision` method in `decision_maker.py` to return a sequence of actions instead of a single action.
2. Updating the `parse_decision` method to handle sequences of actions.
3. Adjusting the `run_autonomous_web_ai` function in `main.py` to iterate over the sequence of actions.

Here are the steps and the corresponding *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

### Step 1: Modify `make_decision` in `decision_maker.py`

decision_maker.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    async def make_decision(self, mapped_elements, task, current_url, previous_action=None):
        # Existing logic to make a decision
        decision = await self.client.generate_decision(mapped_elements, task, current_url, previous_action)
        return decision
=======
    async def make_decision(self, mapped_elements, task, current_url, previous_action=None):
        # Existing logic to make a decision
        decision = await self.client.generate_decision(mapped_elements, task, current_url, previous_action)
        # Assuming the decision now returns a sequence of actions
        return decision['actions']
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Update `parse_decision` in `decision_maker.py`

decision_maker.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def parse_decision(self, decision):
        # Existing logic to parse a single decision
        action = self.client.parse_decision(decision)
        return action
=======
    def parse_decision(self, decision):
        # Existing logic to parse a single decision
        actions = []
        for action in decision:
            parsed_action = self.client.parse_decision(action)
            if parsed_action:
                actions.append(parsed_action)
        return actions
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 3: Adjust `run_autonomous_web_ai` in `main.py`

main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            decision = await decision_maker.make_decision(mapped_elements, parsed_task, new_url, previous_action)

            if decision is None:
                logger.error("Failed to get a decision from AI model. Stopping.")
                break

            action = decision_maker.parse_decision(decision)
            if action is None:
                if not quiet:
                    print("Task completed or invalid decision. Keeping browser open.")
                break

            if not quiet:
                action_description = f"{action['type']} on {mapped_elements[action['element']]['description']}"
                print(f"Action: {action_description}")

            success = await navigator.perform_action(action, mapped_elements)
            if not success:
                logger.error("Failed to perform action. Stopping.")
                break

            previous_action = action  # Update the previous action
=======
            decisions = await decision_maker.make_decision(mapped_elements, parsed_task, new_url, previous_action)

            if not decisions:
                logger.error("Failed to get decisions from AI model. Stopping.")
                break

            actions = decision_maker.parse_decision(decisions)
            if not actions:
                if not quiet:
                    print("Task completed or invalid decision. Keeping browser open.")
                break

            for action in actions:
                if not quiet:
                    action_description = f"{action['type']} on {mapped_elements[action['element']]['description']}"
                    print(f"Action: {action_description}")

                success = await navigator.perform_action(action, mapped_elements)
                if not success:
                    logger.error("Failed to perform action. Stopping.")
                    break

                previous_action = action  # Update the previous action

                # Update mapped elements after each action
                result = await navigator.update_mapped_elements()
                if result is None:
                    logger.error("Failed to update mapped elements. Stopping.")
                    break
                
                mapped_elements, new_url = result

                # Check if URL has changed after the action
                if new_url != current_url:
                    current_url = new_url
                    logger.info(f"URL changed to: {current_url}")

            if not success:
                break
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Suggested Shell Commands

```bash
python main.py "Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo fill the form were my first name is Husam my ln is alshehadat and my email is sam@gmai.com" --method xpath --show-visuals
```

This command will run the updated script with the new task that requires multiple actions on the same page.

It seems like there might be a typo or an outdated reference in your code. The `litellm.llms.anthropic` module does not have an attribute named `AnthropicError`. Instead, you might be looking for a specific exception class provided by the `anthropic` library itself.

To address this, we need to:

1. Ensure that the correct exception handling is used for the `anthropic` library.
2. Update the code to handle exceptions appropriately.

Here are the steps and the corresponding *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

### Step 1: Update the exception handling in `decision_maker.py`

decision_maker.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        except litellm.llms.anthropic.AnthropicError as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error with Anthropic model: {e}")
=======
        except anthropic.APIError as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Error with Anthropic model: {e}")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Suggested Shell Commands

```bash
pip install --upgrade anthropic
```

This command will ensure that you have the latest version of the `anthropic` library installed, which might include the correct exception classes.

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the code. The `litellm.llms.anthropic` module does not have an attribute named `AnthropicError`. Instead, you should handle exceptions directly from the `anthropic` library.

#### only use openai, don't edit anything when it comes to models !!  

Understood. Since we are only using OpenAI and not editing anything related to models, we need to ensure that the exception handling is correctly aligned with OpenAI's exceptions.

To address this, we need to:

1. Ensure that the correct exception handling is used for the OpenAI library.
2. Update the code to handle exceptions appropriately.

            self.logger.error(f"Error with OpenAI model: {e}")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Suggested Shell Commands

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

This command will ensure that you have the latest version of the `openai` library installed, which includes the correct exception classes.
